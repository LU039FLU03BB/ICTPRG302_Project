Guess my Word

Description:

Guess My Word is a command line version of the popular New York Times' game "Wordle".
The player attempts to guess a specific 5-letter word. After each guess,
they'll know which letters are wrong entirely, which letters are right, and which ones are in the word
but need to be in a different position.

The game ends after the player guesses the word correctly or reaches 6 incorrect attempts.

Good luck and happy guessing :)
